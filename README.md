# merge-sort-fpga
Repository containing the design of an IP block for Merge Sort acceleration on FPGA for the FPGA101 PiA Course Project

merge_sort_5 -> comparator tree
merge_sort_7 -> comparator row
3_merge_sort -> hybrid (two comparator trees)

## Introduction
<p align="justify">
This repository contains the design of an IP block for Merge Sort acceleration on FPGA for the FPGA101 PiA Course Project by Politecnico di Milano.

### Directories

The repo contains three different folders for each architecture experimented, namely tree, row, hybrid, a pdf report describing the proceudre adopted and the results obtained and, lastly, a jupyter notebook to run the final designs on the PYNQ-Z2 FPGA and compare their performances with the SW algorithm implementation.
