### Directories

The repo contains three different folders for each architecture experimented, namely tree, row, hybrid, a pdf report describing the proceudre adopted and the results obtained and, lastly, a jupyter notebook to run the final designs on the PYNQ-Z2 FPGA and compare their performances with the SW algorithm implementation.
